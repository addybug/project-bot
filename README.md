# Project Bot
This is a Slack bot I made using Node.js, Bolt.js, and Repl.it for my Women in Computer Science club Slack. Users can add, access, and delete coding project ideas. It is intended to spark creativity. 
### User Guide
`/projects` Lists all projects submitted by club members. <br />
`/addproject <Project Name>` Allows user to add a project to the list. <br />
`/clearprojects` Clears project list. <br />
`/cleanprojects` Deletes duplicate entries. <br />
### To do
- Delete project idea
- Limit editing of list to admins
- Project roulette
