# Project Bot
This is a Slack bot I made using Node.js, Bolt.js, and Repl.it for my Women in Computer Science club Slack. Users can add, access, and delete coding project ideas. It is intended to spark creativity. 
### User Guide
`/projects` Lists all projects submitted by club members. <br />
`/addproject <Project Name>` Allows users to add a project to the list. <br />
`/removeproject <Project Name>` Allows user to remove a project from the list. (Admin only) <br />
`/clearprojects` Clears project list. (Admin only) <br />
`/completed` Lists projects user has completed and date. <br />
`/addcompleted <Project Name>` User can add completed projects to personal list <br />
`/removecompleted <Project Name>` User can add completed projects to personal list <br />
`/clearcompleted` Clears user's completed project list. <br />
### To do
